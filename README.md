# FocusFriends

### Description
Focus Friends is a mobile app that uses a timer to track and record user focus sessions. Users can procure in-app currency from completing focus sessions, and can use this currency to buy items to decorate their digital island. Additionally, users can add friends within the app, and can view their islands as well as compete on daily and weekly focus point leaderboards.
